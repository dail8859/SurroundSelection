## Usage
Select some text and type one of the following characters:
- `'`
- `"`
- `` ` ``
- `(` or `)`
- `[` or `]`
- `{` or `}`
- `<` or `>`

The configuration file SurroundSelection.ini now provides additional characters to surround with.  Use as (for example):

AdditionalChars=*-_

to use '*', '-' and '_' to act as surround characters as the above examples do.

## Installation
Install the plugin by downloading it from the [Release](https://github.com/dail8859/SurroundSelection/releases) page and copy `SurroundSelection.dll` to your `plugins` folder. You can also install it via the Plugin Admin or Plugin Manager (depending on your Notepad++ version).

## Development
The code has been developed using MSVC 2015. Building the code will generate the DLL which can be used by Notepad++. For convenience, MSVC copies the DLL into the Notepad++ plugin directory.
